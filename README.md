# Module 4 Challenge
## Overview of the School District Analysis
The school board has notified Maria that there is a evidence of academic dishonesty; specifically, reading and math grades for Thomas 
High School ninth graders appear to have changed their grades. The school board does not know the full extent of the academic dishonesty,
they want to uphold standards and have asked Maria for help.
Maria has asked me to replace the math and reading scores for Thomas High School with NaNs while keeping the rest of the data intact.
After the math and reading scores have been replaced, Maria would like me to repeat the school district analysis that I did in this module.
